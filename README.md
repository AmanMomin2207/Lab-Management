## Features
 ## The reason behind to choose...
   <ul><li> A time-consuming process, the HOD/principal checks each lab session.</li>
   <li> To avoid manual checking, we are automating this process.</li>
    <li>All faculty entries/exits/lab subjects/practical's will be handled by the system and application.</li></ul>
    
  ## The Proposed System....
   <ul><li>  The current system lab scheduling is done manually. </li>
    <li>A time-consuming process, the HOD/principal checks each lab session.</li>
   <li> To avoid manual checking, we are automating this process.</li>
    <li>All faculty entries/exits/lab subjects/practical's will be handled by the system and application.</li></ul>
